# Briefly

**Briefly** is a Web3-native legal collaboration platform that helps clients navigate the complex world of law in crypto and beyond. By matching users with multiple specialized lawyers, Briefly ensures that even the most complicated cases are handled with the right expertise — collaboratively, transparently, and securely.

## 🚀 Vision

In Web3, legal issues are rarely straightforward. From token compliance and DAO governance to cross-border taxation and financial regulations, clients often need **more than one lawyer**. Briefly makes this possible by:

- Letting verified lawyers create profiles and define their expertise.
- Using AI to match clients with **teams of lawyers** based on case requirements.
- Handling all payments in **crypto (BUSD)** through a secure **escrow system** on the **BSC testnet**.
- Giving lawyers a built-in CRM to collaborate, share documents, and manage cases.

## ⚖️ How It Works

### For Lawyers

- **KYC Verified**: Every lawyer undergoes manual KYC checks by the Briefly team.
- **Profiles & Expertise**: Write a short description of your specialization; our AI generates searchable tags.
- **Collaboration Hub**: Work with other lawyers on shared cases inside a secure CRM.
- **Crypto Escrow Payments**: Receive your share of client payments seamlessly after case completion.

### For Clients

1. **Submit your situation**: Provide details in two steps — your current needs + your future plans.
2. **AI Matching**: Briefly analyzes your case and creates lawyer groups (1–N experts) tailored to your needs.
3. **Choose & Request**: Select the group you want to work with and send a request.
4. **Secure Escrow**: Deposit funds in BUSD; lawyers are paid only after service delivery.
5. **Collaborate with confidence**: All communication and documents are stored securely.
